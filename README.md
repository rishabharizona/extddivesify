SHAP-Enhanced Domain Adaptation for Time-Series Classification
1. Overview

This project implements a domain adaptation algorithm for time-series classification, with a strong emphasis on model explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). The primary goal is to train a robust classifier that generalizes well to new, unseen target domains while providing deep insights into the model's decision-making process.

The pipeline is particularly tailored for high-dimensional data like Electromyography (EMG) signals, featuring a comprehensive suite of SHAP-based metrics and visualizations, including novel 4D SHAP analysis techniques.
2. Core Pipelines
2.1. Training Pipeline

The training process follows a multi-stage domain adaptation strategy. It iteratively updates the model's components to learn domain-invariant features.

2.2. SHAP Explainability & Evaluation Pipeline

After training, the best model is subjected to a rigorous explainability and performance analysis pipeline using SHAP.

3. Key Features

    Domain Adaptation: Implements a sophisticated training regimen to handle domain shift between training and testing data.

    Comprehensive SHAP Analysis: Goes beyond standard summary plots to include:

        Extended Metrics: Flip Rate, Area Over the Perturbation Curve (AOPC), SHAP Entropy, and Feature Coherence.

        Similarity Metrics: Jaccard Index, Kendall's Tau, and Cosine Similarity for comparing SHAP explanations.

    4D SHAP Visualization: Novel methods for visualizing SHAP values for spatio-temporal data, such as multi-channel EMG signals.

    Ablation Studies: Validates the importance of features identified by SHAP by perturbing them and measuring the impact on model performance.

    Detailed Logging & Visualization: Generates numerous plots and logs for training progress, model performance, and SHAP results.

5. Dependencies

The project requires the following major Python libraries. You can install them using pip:

pip install torch pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib shap plotly

6. Datasets Supported

    EMG (electromyography)
